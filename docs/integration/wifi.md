## Wi-Fi Configuration

You can connect the scale to your home or work network by entering the SSID and password on [Settings](/usage/settings.md) page.

### Steps:
1. Enter your **Wi-Fi SSID** and **password** into the respective input fields.
2. Click the **Save WiFi Settings** button.
3. A confirmation message will appear:  
   `"WiFi credentials saved. Reboot to connect."`
4. Reboot the scale.
5. Once connected, access the WebUI by opening a browser and visiting:  
   [`http://weighmybru.local`](http://weighmybru.local)

> ✅ The Wi-Fi credentials are securely saved to the ESP32's EEPROM memory, so you won’t need to re-enter them after rebooting.
