# üõ†Ô∏è Using VSCode Toolbar to View ESP32 Serial Output

This guide explains how to use **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)** and the **PlatformIO extension** to monitor serial debug output from your ESP32 using the **bottom toolbar**‚Äîno terminal commands required.

## üì• Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [PlatformIO IDE extension](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode)
- Correct USB driver for your ESP32 board (e.g. CP210x, CH340, FTDI)

## üîå Step 1: Connect Your ESP32

1. Plug your ESP32 board into your computer using a USB data cable.
2. You should see a small LED light up on the board.

## üìÅ Step 2: Open Your PlatformIO Project

1. Open VSCode.
2. Open your PlatformIO project folder.
3. Wait for the PlatformIO toolbar (bottom blue bar) to appear.
