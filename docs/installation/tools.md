## Essential Tools

| Tool                              | Purpose                                              |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Soldering iron**                | For making electrical connections                    |
| **Solder (lead-free)**            | For securing wires and components                    |
| **Helping hands / PCB vise**      | To hold components while soldering                   |
| **Wire strippers**                | For preparing clean wire connections                 |
| **Flush cutters**                 | To trim leads and wires                              |
| **Screwdrivers (mini set)**       | For assembling enclosures or mounting components     |
| **Multimeter**                    | To test continuity and voltage                       |
| **Hot glue gun** *(optional)*     | For additional mechanical support                    |
| **Tweezers**                      | For handling small parts or wires                    |
| **3D printer** (or access to one) | To print the custom enclosure                        |

## Skills Required

- **Basic soldering skills**: Youâ€™ll be connecting wires to headers, sensors, and small PCB pads. Neat, reliable solder joints are key to a stable scale.
- **Comfort with simple wiring diagrams**: Youâ€™ll need to follow basic circuit connections.
- **Attention to detail**: Precise placement of the load cell and secure mounting are critical for accuracy.
- **Tinkerer mindset**: This is a project for people who enjoy building things with their hands, solving small problems, and customizing their gear.

> ðŸ’¡ *Donâ€™t worry if youâ€™re new to electronicsâ€”this is a great entry-level project as long as you're willing to learn and take your time.*

## Optional Tools
- **USB-C Cable** or reliable USB-C/micro-USB cable
- **Solder Sucker** (for fixing mistakes)
- **Digital Caliper** (to verify fit for 3D-printed enclosures)
- **Heatset Insert Press** (to help place threaded heatset inserts correctly)

Tip: Prepare a Workspace

Make sure your workspace:
- Is well-lit and ventilated
- Has a static-safe surface if you're handling ESP32 boards
- Gives you space to lay out components, tools, and the 3D-printed case
