# Choose Model

What began as a simple, headless espresso scale, AKA WeighMyBru, designed to integrate seamlessly with GaggiMate quickly evolved into something more. As the project matured, new features were added—from Wi-Fi control and calibration to real-time flowrate monitoring. It became clear that a one-size-fits-all solution wouldn't serve every user’s needs.<br><br>
Enter WeighMyBru Mini, WeighMyBru², and beyond— modular versions tailored for different brewing setups and user preferences, without compromising affordability or performance. These models are currently under development.
